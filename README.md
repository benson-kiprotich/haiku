## Description

_This is an assignment for Moringa school to test your understanding of functional programming_

#### Instructions for Haiku Checker/Creator

A haiku is a poem that consists of three lines. The first has five syllables, the second has seven, and the third has five. Start by creating an application that checks whether a poem is in fact a haiku. If you have time, build out your application so that it can randomly generate haikus.

- Your logic should verify that the poem has three lines.
- Your logic should verify English syllable rules (and exceptions) one at a time. A quick Google search will provide information on English syllable rules.
- If you successfully complete a Haiku checker, continue to build out your application to randomly generate haikus.

Make sure you test your application for each new rule you implement.
